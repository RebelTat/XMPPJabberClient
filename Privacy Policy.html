    <h2>Conversations Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Conversations is an XMPP client that connects to an XMPP server. Conversations will never upload data to the developer. The only execption to this rule is data collected after a crash. This data will be send via your own XMPP account but never without your explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>Conversations or its developers donâ€™t have control over the data you send through the app. However the following data might get uploaded to your XMPP provider:</p>
    <h4>Data uploaded to your XMPP provider</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Messages. This includes text messages, images and other files</li>
	<li>Your avatar / profile picture</li>
	<li>Your public keys for the OMEMO encryption</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What does not get uploaded</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>Your contacts. Conversations only asks permissions to read your contact to show the profile pictures and names of the corresponding XMPP contacts. Your contacts are never published anywhere. <strong>If you opt-out of this permission Conversations will work just fine.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Using the conversations.im provider</h4>
    <p>If you use the <em>conversations.im</em> please refer to their <a href="https://account.conversations.im/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Using the conversations.im XMPP provider is optional. Conversations will connect to almost any other XMPP provider.</strong></p>
